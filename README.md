Adding Features (Plugins)
-------------------------

This bot uses [cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch), which makes it mad-super-easy to add features.  Just write a plugin and put it in the `plugins` directory.  Check out some [plugin examples](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch/tree/master/examples/plugins) and take a look at the [plugin documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/cinch/Cinch/Plugin) for more information.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to add your plugin's dependencies to the Gemfile!
